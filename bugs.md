- **Title:** Varchar for Timestamp
- **Area:** DB Model
- **Steps to Reproduce:**
  1. n/a
- **Expected Result:** n/a
- **Actual Result:** n/a

- **Notes:** While mocking test DB, I noticed that the timestamp column is a Varchar. I'm not sure if this is a bug or not. I'll investigate further. `Timestamp` is better practice.
